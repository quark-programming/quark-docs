# Control Statements

Quark provides standard control flow statements such as if and while similar to C. Here are some examples of how to use these control statements in Quark:

```quark
if(/* &lt;condition&gt; */) {
   // code to execute if condition is true
}
\
while(/* &lt;condition&gt; */) {
   // code to execute while condition is true
}
```
