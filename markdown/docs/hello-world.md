# Hello World

Let's write out first program in Quark. Start by creating a new filed with the `.qk` extension. Here I'll use `hello.qk`.

```quark
print("Hello, World!");
```

The Quark compiler automatically imports the standard library, including `lib::io`, which contains the `print()` function used to output text to the console.
